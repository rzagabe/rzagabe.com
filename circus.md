Circus is a cloud orchestration platform that simplifies and speeds up
business application scheduling on clusters of physical or virtual
machines. It enables you to manage your data center as if itâ€™s a
single computer and considerably improve your resource utilization.

As hundreds of data problems are solved and hosted at
[Ognitio](https://ognitio.com/), we wanted to provide developers with
better control and trust over the way they organize and manage their
cluster of hosts. 

Circus is a platform built on top of
[Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) that provides three main
benefits to his users: 

- It abstracts pool of compute resources allowing you to focus on
optimizing your applications without worrying about the
infrastructure.  
- It enables everything you need to build, run and scale thousands of
applications and services in your infrastructure.  
- It promotes a collaborative and transparent environment for your team
members.  

A key component of Circus is the **namespaces**. It enables cluster
operators to easily partition their resources. This mechanism helps
administrators to have full control and visibility over the needs of
multiple user communities.

With namespaces, users are now able to work in isolation from other
communities.

A lot of effort have also been invested into helping Circus users
organize and monitor their hosts at any scale.

applications that run at Ognitio.
